# ClientSupport #
ClientSupport is a MODX extra to allow manager users to ask for help or support from inside the MODX manager.
A button is added to the top right section in your MODX manager, which triggers a popup containing a help form where the user can describe their problem/question.
In addition to the form fields the **username**, **IP address**, **manager page URL** and **browser version** is sent along.

ClientSupport provides built-in branding for Zendesk, Freshdesk and Jira. Be sure to have the email-to-ticket feature enabled in your ticket system and 
set the correct system settings for the ticket system and emailaddress in MODX. When one of the mentioned systems is used the button and form are branded accordingly.

The submitted form is sent to a configurable emailaddress where all the submitted data is shown in the email body.
